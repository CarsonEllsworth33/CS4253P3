INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE FILE
step 1) make sure the necessary files are executable by running
        chmod +x p3runner.sh
        chmod +x backtracking.py
        chmod +x gen-gcp.py
        chmod +x sudoku-generator.py

step 2) The parameters for running are as follows
    $1) the amount of time to test the map and sudoku solving
        e.g. 3 will generate 3 new maps and sudoku CSP's and test them
    $2) the amount of nodes generated by the gen-gcp.py file
        e.g. 20 will generate a size 20 graph for each new test
    $3) the amount of free cells left open by the sudoku generator
        e.g. 30 will create a sudoku puzzle with 30 free cells for each test
    $4) forward checking enable
        0 for False
        1 for True
    $5) ac3 algorithm run count: the maximum amount of times the ac3 algorithm is allowed to run in the program
        e.g. 5 allows the ac3 algorithm to run at maximum 5 times in the program

step 3) run the program
    e.g. ./p3runner.sh 10 50 20 1 0
        run 10 tests with map size of 50 nodes 20 free sudoku cells with all three searches using forward checking but no AC3 runs
